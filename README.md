The ready availability of so many different kind of sensors is incredible. Temperature, humidity, motion, ultrasonic, air quality, sound, light, pressure, gas, moisture, UV, PH, ... the list goes on and on. When you make these sensors web-connected, the possibilities are endless and awesome. The [Grove System](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System) simplifies the process of wiring up sensors and various other electronic components by packaging each sensor/component into modules with a common interface to eliminate the need for complex breadboard wiring. Using a board like a [GrovePi+](http://www.dexterindustries.com/shop/grovepi-board/) connected to a web-connected [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) gives you a Lego-like experience for creating your own electronic masterpieces.
